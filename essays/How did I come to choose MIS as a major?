How did I come to choose MIS as a major? Interlinkages between business and technology have always fascinated me hence I decided to pursue an academic career that encompasses both the business and technical fields. Occupations associated with MIS are also in high demand, with rapid growth expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Upon completing my bachelor's degree, it is my goal to work at a U.S. airbase in Japan for some kind of organization involved in technology. I am looking forward to learning more about fundamental coding, analyzing difficulties (resolving code errors), Javascript, HTML, algorithms, and the like.
